# üö® URGENT: API Recovery Needed

## Current Situation

**Status:** API is DOWN  
**Impact:** Users cannot sign up, frontend is non-functional  
**Cause:** Container deployment failures in Cloud Run

### What Happened
1. User reported: "Unexpected token 'N', 'Not Found' is not valid JSON" when signing up
2. Investigation found: API routes (including `/api/auth/signup`) were not loading
3. Attempted fix: Created minimal API with just auth routes
4. Result: **NEW DEPLOYMENT FAILED** - container won't start
5. Attempted rollback: **ALSO FAILED** - previous revisions also failing now

### Current Status
- **Last Working Revision:** ai-bookkeeper-api-00009-9ww (but not starting now)
- **Failed Revision:** ai-bookkeeper-api-00012-7bf (minimal API)
- **Error:** Container failed to start within timeout
- **API URL:** https://ai-bookkeeper-api-644842661403.us-central1.run.app (DOWN)

## Immediate Actions Required

### Option 1: Restore from Working State (FASTEST - 15 min)

Restore from the last known working Docker image:

```bash
# Find last working image
gcloud container images list-tags us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/bright-fastness-475700-j2/app/api --limit=10

# Deploy specific working digest
gcloud run deploy ai-bookkeeper-api \
  --image us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/bright-fastness-475700-j2/app/api@sha256:WORKING_DIGEST \
  --region us-central1 \
  --project bright-fastness-475700-j2
```

### Option 2: Use Render Backup (IMMEDIATE - 5 min)

Temporarily point frontend to Render API while we fix Cloud Run:

```bash
# Update Vercel env
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL production
# Enter: https://ai-bookkeeper-api.onrender.com (if Render API still exists)

# Redeploy frontend
cd frontend
vercel --prod
```

### Option 3: Fresh Deployment (THOROUGH - 30 min)

1. Test locally first:
```bash
cd /Users/fabiancontreras/ai-bookkeeper
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://neondb_owner:..."
export ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://frontend-ma4iv9gxo-contrejfcs-projects.vercel.app"
python -m uvicorn app.api.main_minimal:app --reload
```

2. Fix any errors found

3. Deploy after local testing passes

## Root Cause Analysis

The API was working (health checks passing) but routes weren't loading because:

1. **Router Import Failures:** Auth router not being included in main_cloudrun.py
2. **Silent Failures:** Import errors being caught but not preventing startup
3. **Missing Dependencies:** Some auth dependencies failing to import

When we tried to fix it:
4. **Minimal API Issues:** Even minimal API has dependency problems
5. **Container Timeout:** App crashes before responding to health checks

## What Works Now
- ‚ùå API is DOWN
- ‚úÖ Frontend is UP (but can't call API)
- ‚úÖ Database is UP (Neon PostgreSQL)
- ‚úÖ Vercel deployment is UP

## What's Broken
- ‚ùå Cloud Run API (all revisions failing)
- ‚ùå User signup
- ‚ùå User login
- ‚ùå All API functionality

## Critical Decision Needed

**YOU NEED TO DECIDE:**

### A. Do we have a Render backup API still running?
If YES ‚Üí Point frontend there immediately while we fix Cloud Run

### B. Do we have access to Cloud Run logs?
If YES ‚Üí We can see exact error and fix quickly

### C. Should we test locally first?
If YES ‚Üí We can verify the fix works before deploying

## Recommendation

**IMMEDIATE (5 min):**
1. Check if Render API is still running
2. If yes, temporarily use it
3. This unblocks users NOW

**SHORT TERM (30 min):**
1. Get Cloud Run logs access or test locally
2. Fix the actual issue
3. Deploy verified working version

**Status:** URGENT - Production is down  
**Next Action:** Decide between options A, B, or C above
