# 🚨 CRITICAL FIX DEPLOYED - Render Configuration Corrected

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### **Backend Service (`ai-bookkeeper-api`)**
- ✅ **rootDir:** Changed from root to `app`
- ✅ **startCommand:** Changed from `uvicorn main:app` to `uvicorn app.api.main:app`
- ✅ **Python Version:** Updated to 3.11.9
- ✅ **ALLOWED_ORIGINS:** Set to `sync: false` (will be configured after web deploy)

### **Frontend Service (`ai-bookkeeper-web`)**
- ✅ **rootDir:** `frontend` (correct)
- ✅ **buildCommand:** Added fallback for package-lock.json
- ✅ **NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL:** Uses `fromService` reference to API

### **Additional Files**
- ✅ **app/main.py:** Import helper for `python -m app`
- ✅ **scripts/smoke.sh:** Simplified smoke test script

## 🔍 What to Watch For

1. **Go to Render Dashboard** and refresh
2. **Look for `ai-bookkeeper-web`** to change from "Failed deploy" to "Deployed"
3. **Both services** should show green "Deployed" status

---

## 📋 Next Steps After Both Services Are Live

### **Step 1: Get Service URLs**
- API: `https://ai-bookkeeper-api.onrender.com`
- Web: `https://ai-bookkeeper-web.onrender.com`

### **Step 2: Configure CORS**
1. Go to `ai-bookkeeper-api` → Environment
2. Set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to:
   ```
   https://ai-bookkeeper-web.onrender.com
   ```
3. Save (auto-redeploys)

### **Step 3: Run Smoke Tests**
```bash
export API_URL=https://ai-bookkeeper-api.onrender.com
export WEB_URL=https://ai-bookkeeper-web.onrender.com
./scripts/smoke.sh
```

**Expected Output:**
```
smoke ok
```

### **Step 4: Test in Browser**
Visit: `https://ai-bookkeeper-web.onrender.com`

Check browser console for any errors.

---

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ `GET https://<api>/healthz` → `{"status":"ok"}`
- ✅ `GET https://<web>/` → 200
- ✅ Browser calls to API succeed without CORS errors
- ✅ `scripts/smoke.sh` passes with live URLs

---

## 🚀 Deployment Status

**Deployed:** October 19, 2025 at 12:45 PM
**Status:** ⏳ Waiting for Render to rebuild both services (~5 minutes)

**Key Changes:**
- Fixed backend rootDir and startCommand
- Corrected FastAPI import path
- Simplified configuration

This should resolve the "Failed deploy" issue on the web service!
