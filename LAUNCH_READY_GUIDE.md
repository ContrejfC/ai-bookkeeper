# ðŸš€ Launch-Ready Guide - Final Steps to Go Live

This guide walks you through the final validation and launch process for Google Ads.

---

## âš¡ Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Validate everything
make validate

# 2. If all 8 tests pass, deploy
git push origin main

# 3. Wait for Render deployment (3-5 minutes)

# 4. Run final checks
make smoke
make usage
make monthend-dry

# 5. Launch ads (follow GOOGLE_ADS_CAMPAIGN_CONFIG.md)
```

---

## ðŸ“‹ The 8 Validation Criteria

Before launching Google Ads, ALL 8 criteria must pass:

### âœ… 1. Domains and CORS Work

**What:** Frontend at `app.ai-bookkeeper.app` calls API at `api.ai-bookkeeper.app` without errors

**Test:**
```bash
# Visit in browser
open https://app.ai-bookkeeper.app/gpt-bridge
# Check DevTools Console - no CORS errors
# Check GA4 DebugView - bridge_viewed event fires
```

**Auto-test:**
```bash
make validate
# Test 1 should pass
```

---

### âœ… 2. Stripe SKUs Match Approved Pricing

**What:** All Stripe price IDs in `config/stripe_price_map.json` match approved pricing

**Approved Pricing:**
- Starter: $49/mo (500 tx, $0.03/tx overage)
- Team: $149/mo (2,000 tx, $0.02/tx overage)
- Firm: $499/mo (10,000 tx, $0.015/tx overage)
- Enterprise: Custom (25,000+ tx, $0.01/tx overage)
- Pilot: $99/mo Ã— 3 months (auto-migrate to Team/Firm)

**Test:**
```bash
make verify-stripe
# Should show all plans, overage prices, and add-ons loaded
```

**Manual:**
1. Open `config/stripe_price_map.json`
2. Verify no "placeholder" values
3. Cross-reference with Stripe Dashboard

---

### âœ… 3. Entitlements and Metering Enforce Quotas

**What:** Usage metering tracks transactions, calculates overage, blocks when exceeded

**Test:**
```bash
make usage
# Expected output:
# - 600 transactions processed
# - 100 overage (600 - 500)
# - $3.00 overage amount (100 Ã— $0.03)
```

**Verification:**
- Starter tenant with 600 proposed tx shows 100 overage
- Export/post blocked when over hard limit (2Ã— quota)
- Overage queued for month-end billing

---

### âœ… 4. Webhooks Update Access Instantly

**What:** Stripe webhooks process in <10 seconds and update entitlements

**Events to test:**
- `checkout.session.completed` - Creates subscription
- `invoice.paid` - Records payment
- `customer.subscription.updated` - Updates entitlements
- `customer.subscription.deleted` - Cancels access

**Manual test:**
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard â†’ Webhooks
2. Find: `https://api.ai-bookkeeper.app/api/billing/webhook`
3. Send test event: `checkout.session.completed`
4. Check Render logs - should process in <10s
5. Check database - subscription created

---

### âœ… 5. E2E Purchase Succeeds

**What:** Complete checkout flow from pricing page to success page

**Steps:**
1. Visit `https://app.ai-bookkeeper.app/pricing`
2. Click "Start Starter"
3. Enter test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
4. Complete checkout
5. Redirect to `/success`
6. GA4 Realtime shows:
   - `purchase` (value: $49)
   - `subscription_started` (value: $49)
7. Stripe Dashboard shows new subscription

**Auto-test:**
```bash
make smoke
# Playwright tests will verify pages load and redirect to Stripe
```

---

### âœ… 6. Month-End Dry Run Works

**What:** Monthly billing job calculates overage and posts to Stripe (idempotent)

**Test:**
```bash
make monthend-dry
# Should show:
# - All subscriptions processed
# - Overage calculated correctly
# - Idempotent (re-running doesn't double-bill)
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# Run twice to verify idempotency
make monthend-dry
make monthend-dry
# Second run should detect existing billing for current month
```

---

### âœ… 7. Legal and Trust Pages Are Public

**What:** Privacy, Terms, DPA, Security pages load without authentication

**Test:**
```bash
make validate
# Test 7 checks all legal pages

# Or manually:
curl https://app.ai-bookkeeper.app/privacy
curl https://app.ai-bookkeeper.app/terms
curl https://app.ai-bookkeeper.app/dpa
curl https://app.ai-bookkeeper.app/security
```

**Verification:**
- All pages return 200 OK
- No authentication required
- Footer links work
- Contact email visible: support@ai-bookkeeper.app

---

### âœ… 8. Performance Is Green

**What:** Key pages load fast (LCP <2.5s), CSV preview <10s

**Test:**
```bash
# Lighthouse audit
npx lighthouse https://app.ai-bookkeeper.app/gpt-bridge --view
npx lighthouse https://app.ai-bookkeeper.app/tools/csv-cleaner --view

# Expected:
# - LCP < 2.5s
# - CLS < 0.1
# - INP < 200ms
# - Performance Score > 90
```

**CSV Performance:**
- Upload sample CSV
- Verify preview renders in <10 seconds
- Verify â‰¤50 rows displayed
